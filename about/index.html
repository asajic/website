          My name is Andrijana Sajic. I am from Morton Grove, IL. I am a third year student at the
          Illinois Institute of Technology majoring in Applied Analytics and minoring in
          Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, listening to music, and
          watching movies. I have two siblings named Kristina and Neven. I also have a pet
          labradoodle named Rusty.
